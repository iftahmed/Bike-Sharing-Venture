# Bike-Sharing-Venture

The question that this project is trying to answer is what can data tell us about customer behavior, from the perspective of a bike sharing company. The datasets used are from Seoul, S.Korea and Porto Portugal and I looked at how many people rented bikes, weather variables, and temporal variables. 

I had to standardize the data between the two cities for easier analysis. This was done primarily in excel. I then used the pandas package to look for trends in our dataset which you can see in the presentation. I then used a linear regression model to quantify the relationship between the weather and temporal variables and the number of people renting bikes.
